## Forest trees

Forest structure is based in subpackages, or *trees*, each of which addresses a specific area of analytics. 

- [**Bonsai**](bonsai.md):
  - Location and call/text log data generation of a synthetic population
  - Input: simulation parameters
  - Current maintainer: Georgios Efstathiadis
- [**Jasmine**](jasmine.md):
  - Location data imputation and mobility summary statistics
  - Input: GPS data
  - Current maintainer: Georgios Efstathiadis

## Expected input data

Input data should be included in one directory. Inside that directory, there should be a direct subdirectory corresponding to each participant ID. Inside each Beiwe ID subdirectory, there should be a direct subdirectory corresponding to each downloaded data stream.

Methods are designed to work on data collected using the Beiwe app, with the types of sensor on/off cycles run by the Beiwe app, and with the csv files containing columns generated by Beiwe or generate data matching the data returned from the Beiwe app. Some methods included in Forest are compatible with other data collection environments, but code changes would be required to make Forest work well with those environments.

## Output & available summary statistics

### GPS

The outputs of the GPS module contains:  
1. summary statistics for all specified participants (.csv);   
2. imputed trajectories (.csv) in terms of timestamp, latitude and longitude. By default, it is set to FALSE;   
3. all_BV_set (.pkl), which is a dictionary, with the key as the user ID and the value as a numpy array, where each column represents [start_timestamp, start_latitude, start_longitude, end_timestamp, end_latitude, end_longitude]. If it is your first time run the code, it is set to NULL by default. If you want to continue your analysis from here in the future, all_BV_set is expected to be an input in your new analysis and it will be updated in that run. The size of the file should be fixed overtime;   
4. all_memory_dict (.pkl), which is also a dictionary, with the key as user ID and the value as a numpy array of other parameters for the user. If it is your first time run the code, it is set to NULL by default. If you want to continue your analysis from here in the future, all_memory_dict is expected to be an input in your new analysis and it will be updated in that run. The size of the file should be fixed overtime.   

#### List of summary statistics

The summary statistics that are generated are listed below:
```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
* - Variable
  - Type
  - Description of Variable
  - Description of What it Measures
* - obs_duration
  - Float
  - The total time when the GPS is on
  - This variable quantifies the missingness and the uncertainty in all other estimates
* - obs_day
  - Float
  - The total time when the GPS is on from 8AM to 8PM
  - This variable quantifies the missingness in daytime and the majority of uncertainty in all other estimates
* - obs_night
  - Float
  - The total time when the GPS is on from 8PM to 8AM
  - This variable quantifies the missingness at night and the minority of uncertainty in all other estimates since the user is most likely at home
* - home_time
  - Float
  - Time spent at home over the course of a day (in hours)
  - Note that a person can have non-zero `Distance traveled` when at home, which would indicate they are moving within their home. When `Home time` is zero, this indicates the person has spent the day away from home. “Home” is the most frequently visited significant location for a person between the hours of 8pm and 8am each day over the course of follow up.
* - dist_traveled
  - Float
  - Total distance travelled over the course of a day (in km)
  - The sum of lengths of all flights. A flight is defined to be a longest straight-line trip of a particle from one location to another without a directional change or pause. Please find the technical details [here](jasmine.md#other-technical-details).
* - radius
  - Float
  - Average radius that a person travels from their center over the course of a day (in km)
  - Centroid = the average of each ‘place visited’ (see definition ‘significant location’) over the course of a day, with weights   proportional to the amount of time spent in the location. The radius of gyration is calculated using a time-weighted average of the distance between each place and the centroid, where weights are measured in the same way.
* - diameter
  - Float
  - Largest distance between any two places that a person visited in a day (in km)
  - Please find the technical details on how a place is defined [here](jasmine.md#other-technical-details)
* - max_dist_home
  - Float
  - Largest distance between any places that a person visited in a day and their home (in km)
  - 
* - num_sig_places
  - int
  - Number of significant visited at any point over the course of a day
  - Significant locations are distinct pauses which are at least 15 minutes long and 50 meters apart. They are determined using K-means clustering on locations that a patient visits over the course of follow up. Set K=K+1 and repeat clustering until two significant locations are within 100 meters of one another. Then use the results from the previous step (K-1) as the total number of significant locations.
* - total_flight_time
  - Float
  - Total time spent in flight over the course of a day (in hours)
  - A flight is defined to be a longest straight-line trip of a particle from one location to another without a directional change or pause.
* - av_flight_length
  - Float
  - Average of the length of all flights (straight line movement) that took place over the course of a day (in km)
  - GPS is converted into a sequence of flights (straight line movement) and pauses (time spent stationary).  A flight is defined to be a longest straight-line trip of a particle from one location to another without a directional change or pause. Note that a long flight could be composed of several short flights with different directions, but when calculating the average, it is the mean of those short flights. Please find the technical details [here](jasmine.md#other-technical-details).
* - sd_flight_length
  - Float
  - Standard deviation of the length of all flights (straight line movement) that took place over the course of a day (in km)
  - GPS is converted into a sequence of flights (straight line movement) and pauses (time spent stationary). The standard deviation of  flights of the day is reported.
* - av_flight_duration
  - Float
  - Average of the duration of all flights (straight line movement) that took place over the course of a day (in hours)
  - GPS is converted into a sequence of flights (straight line movement) and pauses (time spent stationary). The average of the duration of flights of the day is reported.
* - sd_flight_duration
  - Float
  - Standard deviation of the duration of all flights (straight line movement) that took place over the course of a day (in hours)
  - GPS is converted into a sequence of flights (straight line movement) and pauses (time spent stationary). The standard deviation of the duration of flights of the day is reported.
* - total_pause_time
  - Float
  - Total time spent in pause over the course of a day (in hours)
  - A pause is defined to be a longest period of time spent stationary without a directional change or flight.
* - av_pause_duration
  - Float
  - Average of the duration of all pauses that took place over the course of a day (in hour)
  - We consider that a participant has a pause if the distance that he has moved during a 30-s period is less than `r` m. By default, `r`=10.
* - sd_pause_duration
  - Float
  - Standard deviation of the duration of all pauses that took place over the course of a day (in hour)
  - GPS is converted into a sequence of flights (straight line movement) and pauses (time spent stationary). The standard deviation of duration of pauses over the course of a day is reported.
* - entropy
  - Float
  - Entropy measure based on the proportion of time spent at significant locations over the course of a day
  - Letting p_i be the proportion of the day spent at significant location I, significant location entropy is calculated as   -\sum_{i} p_i*log(p_i), where the sum occurs over all non-zero p_i for that day.
* - mis_duration
  - Float
  - Number of hours of GPS data missing over the course of a day
  - 
* - Physical circadian rhythm
  - Not Available
  - A continuous measurement of routine in the interval [0,1] that scores a day with 0 if there was a complete break from routine and 1 if the person followed the exact same routine as have in every other day of follow up
  - For a detailed description of how this measure is calculated, see Canzian and Musolesi's 2015 paper in the Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, titled "Trajectories of depression: unobtrusive monitoring of   depressive states by means of smartphone mobility traces analysis."   Their procedure was followed using 30-min increments as a bin size.
* - Physical circadian rhythm stratified
  - Not Available
  - A continuous measurement of routine in the interval [0,1] that scores a day with 0 if there was a complete break from routine and 1 if the person followed the exact same routine as have in every other day of follow up
  - Calculated in the same way as Physical circadian rhythm, except the procedure is repeated separately for weekends and weekdays.
